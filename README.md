In addition to the complaint management system, the app also provides daily fixed prices for various commodities from the government. This feature ensures that consumers have access to fair pricing information and can make informed purchasing decisions. The project book also discusses the technical specifications of the app, including the programming languages and frameworks used in the development process. The book provides detailed information on the user interface design and back-end implementation of the app, highlighting the challenges and limitations encountered during the development process. The app has the potential to create a significant impact in Bangladesh by promoting fair pricing practices and empowering consumers. It has the potential to help reduce overpricing and increase transparency in the market, benefiting both consumers and businesses.
